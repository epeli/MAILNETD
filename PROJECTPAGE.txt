====== MAILNETD  (Meta Asynchronous Irc Linked Network Email Transport Daemon) ======

This is a super useful gateway for using irc via email client. 

Final assignment for ties323 by Esa-Matti Suuronen <esa-matti Ã¤t suuronen dot org> and Markus Vuorio <mamaarvu @ jyu.fi>



IRC-network for testing: **murrikka.ath.cx 6667**


==== Functionality ====


=== SMTP ===
  * Send messages to irc by setting irc-channel or a nick to the to-field.
    * Ex. #naapurinpoika@IRCnet.irc 
    * Is hash allowed in email address?
  * First message
    * A connection to to specified* irc-network will be made. *Specified when starting the gateway.
    * Nick will be taken from sender-address.
    * POP3 will accept the nick as username.
  * Gateway will autojoin channels as user sends messages.
  * Gateway will disconnect from irc after some idle time.
    * or just after /quit :)

== Notes ==
  * Max message length
  * Irc does not support newlines. 
  * Flood

  
=== POP3 ===
  * Receive messages via POP3-server.
  * All messages of one channel (or query) will be buffered in to a one message.
    * So if user is only on one channel he/she will always get only one (new) message from the server.
    * User can send messages to a channel by using reply.
  * Username will be same as irc-nick.
  * Password will be the first one entered 
    * I think this isn't really required for this assignment... User could be identified  only by username.




==== Possible implementation languages ====
  * Python <- I think we've settled with this, asyncore/asynchat looks nice
  * Java
  * C#
  * <del>Perl</del>
  * LOLCODE
