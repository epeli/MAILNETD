# MAILNETD

This is an old project from my active school days. It is a 2-way gateway, like
Bitlbee is a IRC gateway to other IMs, for using IRC via Email. In other words
with this you can use IRC from Mozilla Thunderbird etc.


Yeah, it makes no sense, but it was very fun to hack on!


This project was developed with [Markus Vuorio][] and it was first bit larger
Python project I've done.
